Hi, I'm @mrwillbarnz

I'm interested in Systems Administration, and Bioinformatics. 
I'd like to learn how to contribute back to Bioinformatics projects, specifically I would like to work more on code documentation in the future.

I'm looking to collaborate more on improving documentation for a variety of projects.

I am not longer on Twitter/X, however you can follow me [@Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@mrwillbarnz)
